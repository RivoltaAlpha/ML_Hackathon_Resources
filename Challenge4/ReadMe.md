## This one is for Anyone Who is here to LearnðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ¥³

## Objective
Participants will build an ML model using a provided dataset.

## Steps

1. **Dataset Selection**: Provide a clean, well-documented dataset.
2. **Problem Statement**: Define the task (e.g., classification, regression).
3. **Tools**: Access to ML libraries and tools.
4. **Evaluation**: Model accuracy, methodology, and presentation.
5. **Submission**: Model, code, and documentation. Use a Zip folder and upload it on Google Drive or a GitHub link (Preferred).
6. **Support**: In case of any problem, don't hesitate to ask for guidance.

### Submission Guidelines

- **Model**: Submit the trained model.
- **Code**: Provide the code used to train the model.
- **Documentation**: Include detailed documentation explaining the approach, model architecture, and results.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Model Architecture**: Creativity and appropriateness of the model design.
- **Performance**: Accuracy and efficiency of the model.
- **Innovation**: Novelty and originality in solving the problem.
