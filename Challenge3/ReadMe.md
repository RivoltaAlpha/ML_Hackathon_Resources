# Challenge 3: Building an ML Model from Scratch with Your Own Data

## Welcome ML EngineersðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž!

### Objective
Build an ML model from scratch using your own data.

### Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Gather or generate your own datasets.
2. **Problem Statement**: Define the problem you aim to solve.
3. **Tools**: Utilize ML libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess data quality, model performance, and innovation.
5. **Submission**: Submit your model, dataset, and documentation. Use a Zip folder and upload it on Google Drive or a GitHub link (Preferred).
6. **Support**: In case of any problem, don't hesitate to ask for guidanceðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ.

### Submission Guidelines

- **Model**: Submit the trained model.
- **Code**: Provide the code used to train the model.
- **Documentation**: Include detailed documentation explaining the approach, model architecture, and results.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Model Architecture**: Creativity and appropriateness of the model design.
- **Performance**: Accuracy and efficiency of the model.
- **Innovation**: Novelty and originality in solving the problem.
